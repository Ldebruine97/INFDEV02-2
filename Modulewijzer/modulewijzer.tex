\section{Introduction}
The course continues the students path along becoming competent, thorough, and aware programmers. In particular, we will focus the whole course on one of the fundamental mechanisms for extending our toolset: abstraction of data structures and abstraction of computations.


\section{Leerdoelen}
\begin{itemize}
\item Abstraction of data structures through Python classes
\item Recursive data structures (list, map)
\item Abstraction of computations through Python fuctions
\item Recursive functions (list, map)
\item Higher order functions
\item Abstraction of data structures and computations: Python classes with methods
\end{itemize}
